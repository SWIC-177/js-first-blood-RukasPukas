# Thoughts

I have really enjoyed this! I personally am not the biggest fan of HTML and CSS.

Though Tailwind is pretty exciting stuff, which may persuade me otherwise.

JavaScript seems to be different in a way that I have not noticed between other languages. Most of them being just syntax changes or other subtle changes between the languages that you can figure out pretty quickly.

The template literal approach seem to be an interesting method to perform string concatenation that I would have not expected. (StringBuilder in Java is what I am most familiar with which seems to be setup nothing quite like the 'template literal' even though they accomplish the same thing). Also the usage of backticks is not to common for me either.

Arrow functions seem kind of cool as a way to kind of stsreamline the code. Changing:  
const addition = function(num1 + num2){  
return num1 +num2  
}  
To:  
const addition = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;  
Seems like a much more straight-forward approach.

Overall I am enjoying this quite a bit. I even had everything work properly with cloning the repo, npm install, and pushing the work on the first attempt which was a relief. :smiling_face_with_tear:
